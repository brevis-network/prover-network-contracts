### Prover Network - Deployment Environment (Config-only)
# Copy this file to .env and fill in values. Scripts require DEPLOY_CONFIG (JSON)
# and use env only for RPC/signing. All parameters and addresses come from JSON.
# Example to load for a session: set -a; source scripts/.env.example; set +a

# ===== RPC / VERIFICATION =====
# RPC endpoint used by forge when broadcasting
RPC_URL=

# Block explorer API key for contract verification (required if using --verify)
# For Etherscan-based explorers (Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, etc.)
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=

# For Blockscout-based explorers, set the verifier URL instead of API key
# Example: VERIFIER_URL=https://explorer.example.com/api
# Note: Blockscout doesn't require an API key for verification
VERIFIER_URL=

# ===== CONFIG-DRIVEN DEPLOYMENT =====
# Required path to JSON config (see scripts/example_config.json). All parameters/addresses
# must be declared in this file; there are no parameter env fallbacks.

# ===== DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION =====
# Private key of the deployer account (pays gas fees and becomes initial owner)
PRIVATE_KEY=

# NOTE: The deployer will be the initial owner of all contracts.
# For production, transfer ownership to a multisig after deployment.
